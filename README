Linux Live Response Script

Steps to use Response Script:

1.  Open terminal and cd into the response script directory

2.  Use ls to confirm that you are in the correct directory (you should see response, Tools, Collect, ldd_output, README)

3.  Execute response as either root (sudo -i) or sudo user
	Ex: sudo ./response

4. Type in your name, case title, date, time, and directory where you want to store the information. 

5. The response script will run and at the end will ask for the device file name for the host hard drive and USB drive. Ex: /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, etc

6.  The script will prompt the user if they want to dump the systems memory.  If they choose yes, the script will compile LiME and dump the memory.  (Default is Yes)

7.  Afterwards the script will determine whether the USB drive has enough space to create a forensic image.  If it does it prompts the user if they want to create one.
If the user chooses yes, the script creates an image, if the user chooses no, the script ends.  (Default is No)

8.  Output is stored in the Collect folder.
